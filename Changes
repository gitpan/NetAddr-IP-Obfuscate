Revision history for Perl extension NetAddr::IP::Obfuscate.

0.01  Wed Jun 22 15:22:28 2005
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.23 with options
		-XAn NetAddr::IP::Obfuscate

0.02  Fri Jun 24 14:06:00 2005
	- Got rid of File::Slurp, after I noticed differences
	in STDIN handling between 9999.01 and 9999.09. Replaced
	with my own _file_slurp and _file_burp. Not quite as
	fast, but one less dependency. Changed "STDIN" argument
	to "-" to be more like Perl's own open.
